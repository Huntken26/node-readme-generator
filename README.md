## CREDIT/ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:

Thank you to my instructor Kyle Davis because I used the examples from class to complete this project. <br/>
Files 28-Stu-Mini-Project, 19-Stu-Inquirer, and 13-Ins Read-Write-File were especailly helpful and I used some functions/code from each of these class examples. I also used https://www.setcorrect.com/portfolio/work11/ to learn how to add the table of contents with markup language. I'd also like to give a thanks to my tutor Chris Baird, my TA Ethan Cho and my fellow bootcampers for answering and asking pivotal questions.
